# STEP 0-INSTALL CLIENT TOOLS BEFORE BOOTSTRAPPING THE CLUSTER.

First, you will need some client tools installed and configurations made on your client workstation:

awscli – is a unified tool to manage your AWS services
kubectl – this command line utility will be your main control tool to manage your K8s cluster. You will use this tool so many times, so you will be able to type ‘kubetcl’ on your keyboard with a speed of light. You can always make a shortcut (alias) to just one character ‘k’. Also, add this extremely useful official kubectl Cheat Sheet to your bookmarks, it has examples of the most used ‘kubectl’ commands.
cfssl – an open source toolkit for everything TLS/SSL from Cloudflare
cfssljson – a program, which takes the JSON output from the cfssl and writes certificates, keys, CSRs, and bundles to disk.
Install and configure AWS CLI
Configure AWS CLI to access all AWS services used, for this you need to have a user with programmatic access keys configured in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):

Generate access keys and store them in a safe place.

On your local workstation download and install the latest version of AWS CLI

To configure your AWS CLI – run your shell (or cmd if using Windows) and run:

Test your AWS CLI by running and check if you can see VPC details:

`aws ec2 describe-vpcs`

Install kubectl
Kubernetes cluster has a Web API that can receive HTTP/HTTPS requests, but it is quite cumbersome to curl an API each and every time you need to send some command, so kubectl command tool was developed to ease a K8s administrator’s life.

With this tool you can easily interact with Kubernetes to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, view logs and perform many more administrative operations.

Installing kubectl

Linux Or Windows using Gitbash or similar tool

Download the binary:

`wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.21.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl`

[Download Binary](./images/binary-dwnld.PNG)

Make it executable:

`chmod +x kubectl`

Move to the Bin directory:

`sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/`

[Download Binary](./images/chmod-sudo.PNG)

Verify that kubectl version 1.21.0 or higher is installed:

`kubectl version --client`

Install CFSSL and CFSSLJSON
cfssl is an open source tool by Cloudflare used to setup a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI Infrastructure) for generating, signing and bundling TLS certificates. In previous projects you have experienced the use of Letsencrypt for the similar use case. Here, cfssl will be configured as a Certificate Authority which will issue the certificates required to spin up a Kubernetes cluster.

Download, install and verify successful installation of cfssl and cfssljson:

Install CFSSL and CFSSLJSON

Install CFSSL and CFSSLJSON-linux:

`wget -q --show-progress --https-only --timestamping \
  https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-the-hard-way/cfssl/1.4.1/linux/cfssl \
  https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-the-hard-way/cfssl/1.4.1/linux/cfssljson`
